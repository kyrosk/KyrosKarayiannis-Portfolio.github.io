            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I've spent nearly 13 years on the football field, honing my skills and cultivating a deep passion for the game. Beyond sports, I've found solace in the soothing strums of my guitar and the joy of expressing myself through singing. Yet, my life isn't confined to indoor pursuits; I have an insatiable love for fishing and outdoor sports that fuels my adventurous spirit. I thrive on adrenaline rushes and challenge myself to push boundaries. I'm also an avid traveler, constantly seeking new horizons and immersing myself in different cultures, savoring the richness of the world's diversity. Whether it's wandering through bustling markets in Asia or exploring ancient ruins in Europe, I find genuine joy in the journey. And when the opportunity arises, I love to dive into crystal-clear waters for a refreshing swim, connecting with nature in its most elemental form. In the professional realm, my aspirations extend beyond the football field. Simultaneously, I'm drawn to the captivating worlds of web development, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence environments, sensor-based systems, user interface designs, interactive environments and human-computer interaction, crafting digital landscapes with creativity and precision. These are not just career paths; they represent my passion for technology and its potential to shape the way we interact with the digital world. My life is a dynamic blend of sportsmanship, creativity, outdoor exploration, a relentless pursuit of new challenges, and an unquenchable thirst for discovering the beauty of our planet and its people.</p>

                    <p>As part of my dissertation for the successful completion of my Masters degree, I 
                        created an interactive prototype using Figma (prototype tool) to provide smart 
                        homes privacy and security as well as the ability to manipulate, secure and control 
                        the data of their smart home devices. Alongside with data safety, the dissertation 
                        examined ways to support usersâ€™ security through different frameworks applied 
                        in the prototype.</p>

                    <p>Using ONE simulator, I evaluated the performance of opportunistic routing protocols ( epidemic and spray and wait) through an emergency scenario. This project aimed to find out if and how such protocols can be developed and used in real-life situations where mobile networks are not available due to high-traffic zones and transfer emergency messages to local authorities.</p>
